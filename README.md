# Hello_World
Initial newbie repo
My name is Scott Wight, I am new to GitHub and to programming in general.  Well, that is not completely true, I did take a couple of programming courses as an undergrad but that was 30 years ago and was on a dumb terminal so this is all new to me.
My typing skills need work!
